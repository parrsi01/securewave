# SecureWave VPN

SecureWave is a website-first VPN control plane built with FastAPI. The site manages accounts, subscriptions, device provisioning, and WireGuard configuration delivery. VPN tunneling is handled by the WireGuard clients on user devices.

## Local Run

```bash
bash deploy.sh local
```

Alternative:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Azure App Service Deploy

```bash
bash deploy.sh azure
```

Or the single-app deploy script:

```bash
export AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP="your-rg"
export AZURE_APP_NAME="your-app"

bash deploy_securewave_single_app.sh
```

## Runtime Endpoints

- Health: `/health` and `/api/health`
- API Docs (non-production): `/api/docs`
- App Pages: `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/vpn`, `/settings`, `/subscription`

## VPN Notes

- WireGuard configs and QR codes are generated by the backend.
- The website does not create tunnels; users import configs into WireGuard apps.
- VPN performance tests reflect the OS-level tunnel on the device running the tests.

## Demo Scope

See `DEMO.md` for what is complete and what is deferred beyond Phase 1.
