# rive_native

Rive Native is a Dart plugin that interfaces with the [core Rive C++ runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-runtime), powered by the [Rive Renderer](https://rive.app/renderer).

Additional documentation:

For up to date information on Rive Native, see the [official documentation](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/flutter/rive-native).

## Which Package to use

While you can use `rive_native` on its own, we recommend using the [Rive Flutter package](https://pub.dev/packages/rive) (version `0.14.0+`). The `rive` package includes `rive_native` as a dependency and provides a more intuitive runtime API.

## Getting started

`rive_native` is not yet publicly available on GitHub but will be soon. For now, you can pull the source code and example by running:

```bash
dart pub unpack rive_native # Unpack the package source code and example app
cd rive_native/example      # Navigate to the example folder
flutter create .            # Create the platform folders
flutter pub get             # Fetch dependencies
flutter run                 # Run the example app
```

A higher-level declarative API is under development to simplify working with Rive graphics in Flutter.

For an example implementation, see the `rive_player.dart` file in `rive_native/example/rive_player.dart`.

## Feature support

All core Rive features are supported. See [Feature Support](https://rive.app/docs/feature-support) for more information.

---

## Troubleshooting

The required native libraries should be automatically downloaded during the build step (`flutter run` or `flutter build`). If you encounter issues, try the following:

1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run`

Alternatively, you can manually run the `rive_native` setup script. In the root of your Flutter app, execute:

```bash
dart run rive_native:setup --verbose --clean --platform macos
```

This will clean the `rive_native` setup and download the platform-specific libraries specified with the `--platform` flag. Refer to the **Platform Support** section above for details.

---

## Building `rive_native`

By default, prebuilt native libraries are downloaded and used. If you prefer to build the libraries yourself, use the `--build` flag with the setup script:

```bash
flutter clean # Important
dart run rive_native:setup --verbose --clean --build --platform macos
```

> **Note**: Building the libraries requires specific tooling on your machine. Additional documentation will be provided soon.

---

## Testing

Shared libraries are included in the download/build process. If you've done `flutter run` on the native platform, the libraries should already be available.

Otherwise, manually download the prebuilt libraries by doing:

```bash
dart run rive_native:setup --verbose --clean --platform macos
```

Specify the desired `--platform`, options are `macos`, `windows`, and `linux`.

Now you can run `flutter test`.

Optionally build the libraries if desired:

```bash
dart run rive_native:setup --verbose --clean --build --platform macos
```
