# Optional ML Enhancement Packages
# Install these ONLY if you want ML-enhanced VPN optimization
# The optimizer works fine without them using MARL-only mode

# Machine Learning for VPN Optimization (Optional)
xgboost==2.1.3
numpy==1.26.4
scikit-learn==1.5.2

# Note: If these are not installed, the optimizer automatically
# falls back to MARL-only mode with rule-based optimization
