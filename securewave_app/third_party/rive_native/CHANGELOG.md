## 0.1.4

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Build & Platform Updates

- Rive Renderer support for Linux
- Linux is now fully supported. Known issue: arm64 builds are not yet included; for now, build manually: https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/flutter/rive-native#building-rive-native
- Fixes a build issue where scripting build files were missing. We previously did not include the `scripting` folder, which is now required by other build files.
- Fixed a build issue when running ``dart run rive_native:setup --build`.
- Resolves `dart run rive_native:setup` concurrency issue [rive-flutter#609](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/609). Downloads now use a unique temporary directory to support concurrent CLI runners.

## 0.1.3

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Build & Platform Updates

- Adds Swift Package Manager support. Resolves issue [557](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/557)

## 0.1.2

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
- Updated the minimum Flutter version to `3.28.0`. The Android platform code requires the new `onSurfaceCleanup` and `onSurfaceAvailable` methods, see [SurfaceProducer](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/view/TextureRegistry.SurfaceProducer.Callback.html).
- Add `enumType` string getter to `ViewModelInstanceEnum` which returns the name of the enum (not the property name).
- Add `valueStream<T>` to data binding properties that are observable (implementations of `ViewModelInstanceObservableValue`), which returns a `Stream<T>`. For example:

```
ViewModelInstanceNumber? numberProperty = viewModelInstance!.number('age');
Stream<double> stream = numberProperty!.valueStream;
```

### Fixes

- Fixed iOS/macOS build issues when using custom schemes and flavors. See issue [594](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/594).

## 0.1.1

- Adds runtime [Rive Scripting](https://rive.app/docs/scripting/getting-started) support.
- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Fixes

- Fixed [585](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/585) - missing `artboard` `DataType` enum.

## 0.1.0

### Fixes

- Fixed Android build issues in certain environments. See issue [555](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/555). Build commands are now executed from Gradle instead of CMakeLists, and the setup process automatically skips `rive_native:setup` if the required libraries are already downloaded.

### Build & Platform Updates

- Android: Added support for skipping automated setup by setting `rive.native.skipSetup=true` in your app's `gradle.properties`. When enabled, you must manually run `dart run rive_native:setup --verbose --clean --platform android` to download the required libraries.

## 0.0.17

- Marks methods to access text runs and state machine inputs as deprecated. While this functionality won't be removed in the near future, we encourage adoption of data binding to future-proof your Rive usage.

### Fixes

- Improved library loading and error message. See issue [566](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/566)
- Fixed layout issues that occurred on first render when using `Fit.layout` by correcting the order of artboard resizing and advancing calls. Added a new `RiveArtboardLayoutMixin` that provides common layout options for painters, including fit mode, alignment, and scale factor controls.
- Resolves an issue where under some conditions the graphic may not restart the animation ticker. Adds a `isTickerActive` to `RivePainter`.
- Fixed a lifetime issue with `FileAsset`s when the owning Rive `File` is destroyed.
- Only send `textureFrameAvailable` on main (platform) thread (iOS and macOS). This likely resolves crashes observed during Flutter engine teardown when using `Factory.rive`.

- Resolved [an issue](https://community.rive.app/c/support/rive-native-rendering-visible-aliasing-jagged-edges) where upscaling Rive widget transforms resulted in blurry textures when using `Factory.rive`.
- Fixed layout problems that occurred when certain `Fit` modes were used and the user switched to a different DPI screen.
- Adds `addAdvanceRequestListener` to `StateMachine` and `ViewModelInstance`. This is used internally by the `rive` package to force advance on view model property change, and input changes.
- Fixed instances where pointer exit was not working

## 0.0.8

- Expose `width` and `height` getters for `ImageAsset`. See issue [501](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/501). This is only exposed to support older workflows. We now recommend using [Data Binding images](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/data-binding#images). You can also alternatively expose the width and height of the component through data binding and listen to changes.

### Fixes

- Fixed a memory leak when listening to Rive Events that had Audio events. See issue [494](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/494)
- Fixed a memory issue on WASM where large .riv files could invalidate our backing TypedArray views. This fix recreates these views if they are detached. See: https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/7294

### New Features

- **Data binding artboards**:
  You can now data bind artboards and update them programatically. Access a `ViewModelInstanceArtboard` by its path using `artboard(String path)` on a view model instance. To update, set the `value` by passing in a `BindableArtboard`. Create a `BindableArtboard` from a Rive file: `riveFile.artboardToBind(String name)` See the [runtime](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/data-binding) docs for data binding artboards.
- **Detect Rive Renderer support**:
  You can now detect Rive Renderer support by doing `Factory.rive.isSupported` after `RiveNative.init()`.

### Fixes

- Fixed a crash when using the Flutter renderer.
- Allow Rive Native to still work even if the Rive Renderer context does not initialize.

## 0.0.3

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest bug fixes and performance improvements.

### New Features

- **Data binding lists**:
  You can now get a list property on a `ViewModelInstance` by its path using `list(String path)`. On this property you can perform common list operations, such as, `add`/`remove`/`insert`. See [Editor](https://rive.app/docs/editor/data-binding/lists) and [runtime](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/data-binding) docs for data binding lists.

### Fixes

- Fixed a crash on Android when backgrounding the app using the Rive Renderer. See issue [481](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/481).
